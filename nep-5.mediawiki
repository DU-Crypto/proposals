==Abstract==

The NEP-5 Proposal outlines a token standard for the NEO blockchain that will provide systems with a generalized interaction mechanism for tokenized Smart Contracts.  This mechanic, along with the justification for each feature are defined.  A template and examples are also provided to enable the development community.

==Motivation==

As the NEO blockchain scales, Smart Contract deployment and invocation will become increasingly important.  Without a standard interaction method, systems will be required to maintain a unique API for each contract, regardless of their similarity to other contracts.  Tokenized contracts present themselves as a prime example of this need because their basic operating mechanism is the same.  A standard method for interacting with these tokens relieves the entire ecosystem from maintaining a definition for basic operations that a required by every Smart Contract that employs a token.

==Specification==


In the Event definitions below, we provide both the definitions of the functions as they are defined in the contract as well
as the invoke parameters.  Note that we have provided the hex string for the event as the second input.  The first input is
the contract invoker's public key.  Reference: https://github.com/neo-project/docs/blob/master/en-us/sc/tutorial/Lock2.md 
===Event: deploy===
<code>private static bool Deploy(byte[] originator, BigInteger supply)</code>
Invoke: <code>byte[] originator, "6465706c6f79" , byte[] supply</code>

"deploy" is used to release the tokens into the contract.  It evaluates the invoker's public key against the admin key prior to release all tokens to the admin.


===Event: totalSupply===
<code>private static BigInteger totalSupply()</code>
Invoke: <code>byte[] originator, "746f74616c537570706c79"</code>

"totalSupply" returns the total token supply deployed in the system.

===Event: name===
<code>private static string name()</code>
Invoke: <code>byte[] originator, "6e616d65"</code>

"name" returns the token name.

===Event: symbol===
<code>private static string symbol()</code>
Invoke: <code>byte[] originator, "73796d626f6c"</code>

"symbol" returns the token symbol.

===Event: decimals===
<code>private static BigInteger decimals()</code>
Invoke: <code>byte[] originator, "646563696d616c73"</code>

"decimals" returns the number of decimals used by the token.

===Event: balanceOf====
<code> private static BigInteger balanceOf(byte[] account)</code>
Invoke: <code>byte[] originator, "62616c616e63654f66", byte[] account</code>

"balanceOf" returns the token balance of the '''account'''.

===Event: transfer===
<code>private static bool Transfer(byte[] originator, byte[] to, BigInteger amount)</code>
Invoke: <code>byte[] originator, "7472616e73666572", byte[] to, byte[] amount</code>

"transfer" will transfer an '''amount''' of tokens from the '''originator''' account to the '''to''' account.

===Event: transferFrom===
<code>private static bool TransferFrom(byte[] originator, byte[] from, byte[] to, BigInteger amount)</code>
Invoke: <code>byte[] originator, "7472616e7366657246726f6d", byte[] from, byte[] to, byte[] amount </code>

"transferFrom" will transfer an '''amount''' from the '''from''' account to the '''to''' acount if the '''originator''' has been approved to transfer the requested '''amount'''.

===Event: approve===
<code>private static bool Approve(byte[] originator, byte[] to, byte[] amount)</code>
Invoke: <code>byte[] originator, "617070726f7665", byte[] to, byte[] amount</code>

"approve" will approve the '''to''' account to transfer '''amount''' tokens from the '''originator''' acount. 

===Event: allowance===
<code>private static BigInteger Allowance(byte[] from, byte[] to)</code>
Invoke: <code>byte[] originator, "616c6c6f77616e6365", byte[] from, byte[] to</code>

"allowance" will return the amount of tokens that the '''to''' account can transfer from the '''from''' acount.
